    "Wildland ﬁre is prevalent in western United States and Canada and currently nearly whole Australia. Therefore, for the savety of firefighters and the preservation of forest resources, it is imperative to predict wildland fire behavior accurately. When an unexpected wildland fires occurs, knowing the fire size and shape could help the management staff to  assess the impact on land resources and then dispatch the suppression forces(Anderson 1983). \n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous models, hitherto, have been developed for fire behavior prediction and thus providing practical tools for ﬁreﬁghting resource managers. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, advanced technologies have sparked a fair amount of fires behavior simulations (Beer 1990b; Green et al. 1990; French 1992; Coleman and Sullivan 1996). Generally, two main approaches to representing fire behaviors have been implemented in several simulation models. The first one is considering the fire as a set of continuous but independent cells that spreads in the growth of number, which is described as a raster implementation. The second one holds the view that the fire perimeter is a closed curve of linked points, which is described as a vector implementation (Sullivan 2009). Also, two main approaches to representing the propagation of the fire with some forms of expansion algorithm are used in these models. The first one expands the perimeter based on a direct-contact or near-neighbour proximity (Rothermel 1972). The second one is based on Huygens’wavelet principle in which each point on the perimeter becomes the source of the interval of fire spread (Anderson 1982). \n",
    "\n",
    "Rothermel's (1972) mathematical model calculates ﬁre spread rates toward all neighboring cells to predict how far a fire would travel in a given situation and Anderson (1982) discussed methods of predicting wind-driven wildland fire sizes and shapes, using an ellipse (figure 1) to define the fire shapes with the long axis aligned in the wind direction. DEVS-FIRE, constructed and described by the Discrete Event System Speciﬁcation (Zeigler et al. 2000) will be the focus of this study. It implemented a raster-based ﬁre representation to divide the ﬁre space into contiguous cells and proximity propagation algorithm to describe fire expansion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the simulation of the fire spread, fire-atmosphere interactions should be also accounted for to predict fire behavior more accurately. CAWFE (Clark et al. 2004) and WRF-FIRE (Mandel et al. 2011) treat fire-atmosphere feedbacks in different ways. In our study, the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) model is used. Fire–atmosphere feedbacks are represented by transferring heat fluxes from DEVS-FIRE to ARPS and transferring the resulting changes in near-surface wind from ARPS to DEVS-FIRE (Dahl 2015). \n",

    "# Program Description\n",

    "\n",
    "DEVS-FIRE models the ﬁre area as a set of rectangular cells. Each cell contains the information about fuel types, terrains, and weather conditions according to the spatial geographic information system (GIS) data and weather data. However, these information would be assume to be spatially constant within each cell (Dahl 2015). DEVS-FIRE model has been written in Java. In this project, I'll start to describe fire behavior with some easy assumptions. First, the fire would definitely spread in a circle without any external forces. Second, I'll try to add wind condition to it step by step, contant wind and variable wind (direction and speed), which makes the fire shape become an ellipse and then non-geometric shape. Then I'll try to consider fuel condition, resulting in a turbulent fire shape. After these basic simulations, I'll try to understand the DEVS-FIRE Java Code and maybe translat it into Python. And if possible, writing the interface between this DEVS-FIRE model and the ARPS model in FORTRAN to account for coupled ﬁre–atmosphere feedbacks could be expected, which could be a future job as well. DEVS-FIRE code is available at http://35.12.130.103/study/2019-gcc-g77-java-test/."
